## 🛠️ Implementation

To implement the function in your code, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the necessary files from the provided link.
2. Include the JavaScript file containing the function in your project.
3. Call the `computeDoubleWordProduct` function, passing two signed 32-bit integers as arguments.
4. Receive the double word product of the input integers as the output.

```javascript
// Example Usage
const int1 = 2147483647; // Maximum positive 32-bit integer
const int2 = -2147483648; // Minimum negative 32-bit integer

const result = computeDoubleWordProduct(int1, int2);
console.log(result); // Output: -4611686014132420608
```
